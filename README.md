# Hqllr — Document Indexer
*A lightning-fast, local-first knowledge indexer.*

Hqllr transforms raw documents into compact, deduplicated knowledge ready for instant search and verifiable answers.

## Why Hqllr
- **Local & Sovereign** — runs offline; your data stays yours.
- **Atomised & Deduped** — stores only what’s unique; saves space and time.
- **Instantly Searchable** — built for rapid lookups at any scale.
- **Provenance-Ready** — designed so downstream answers can cite and verify.

## Status
> **Preview** – architecture and APIs here are high-level; core internals are private while we harden the engine.
- Public demos, schemas, and examples will land first.
- Full ingest features will appear in staged releases.

## Get Started (Preview)
- Examples: `examples/` show how to prepare data and query mock indices.
- CLI (preview): `hqllr --help` *(when published)*

## Roadmap
- [ ] Preview demos & mock datasets
- [ ] Public CLI (read-only)
- [ ] SDK bindings (Dart/Go/Python)
- [ ] Private ingest beta (early access)

## Security & Privacy
- Built for offline/sovereign use. No telemetry by default.
- See `SECURITY.md` and `PRIVACY.md`.
